The python files of this folder compute the results shown in Figures 7 and Supplementary Figures S6

(I) model_2types/simulate_data_2types.py

Calculate infomration contour and firing rate contour for the 2-neuron model, with parameters estimated from the data

With that the following figures can be generated:
	- Information contour of the 2-neuron model (Fig 7C)
	- Firing rate contour of the 2-neuron model (Fig 7D)

(II) model_2types/sig1_sig2_R1_R2_contour_a.py ~ sig1_sig2_R1_R2_contour_g.py

Calculate information contour and firing rate contour for the 2-neuron model, with different parameters shown in Fig S6

With that the following figures can be generated:
	- Information contour and firing rate contour of the 2-neuron model, in different conditions (Fig S6 A-G)

(III) model_3types/simulate_data_3types.py

Calculate infomration contour and firing rate contour for the 3-neuron model, with parameters estimated from the data

(IV) model_3types/find_max_info.py

Find local maxima of mutual information of the 3-neuron model
